# AEM: Let's Get Started

## Get Started

### Instance Types

-   AEM deployed on Prem (locally). Managed by you
-   AEM as a Managed Service is setup and maintained by Adobe
-   AEM as a Cloud Service scales and managed automatically as needed

### Navigate the Site Structure

CRXDE is the IDE (integrated Development Environment)

Can't access CRXDE Lite using AEM as a Cloud Service!

If developing with Cloud Service, work locally with a quick start JAR.

Content folder contains site structure

Apps folder contains source code (both developer and core). Also contains APIs to get components from JCR to assemble them on a page.

Libs folder contains source code for AEM

Apps and Libs folder is consider immutable since author can't alter it. Content folder is mutable since author can alter it.

### Touch UI, OmniSearch, and Filter

Cloud Service doesn't have access to Classic UI

Cloud Service can't show Devloper View in Touch UI

# The First Time Manager

## Chapter 2 - Starting Out

### First Week on the Job

* Some coworkers may not be happy with your appointment as manager and may wish you to fail
* Some will try to get brownie points
* Others will have a wait and see approach

How you are viewed may depend on how your predicessor was viewed

#### Don't make immediate changes

Changes may be construed as threatening

Communicate changes ahead of when they will be taken

The more forthcoming and truthful you can be is helpful, though some info can be withheld

#### Lift Up Rather Than Looking for Your Own Help Up

Subordinates have more to do with your future than your superiors

#### Use authority sparingly

Better to make requests and have to turn up authority than to start with too much authority and have it rebuked. If you're already at 11, you have no further leverage.

#### One on Ones

Within the first 60 days, have a personal conversation with each of the people within your personal responsibility

Don't do this in the first week or so

Don't make this a big conversation. Mainly just opening up space for dialog

Be a listener as much as possible 

#### Getting to Know Them

Show genuine interest in their concerns and in their ambitions within the company

Ask questions to further the discussion

Seeing progress towards their goals helps them feel confident

Your goal is for them to have confidence that you are there to help them achieve their goals

Make yourself available for solving small problems, etc

#### Having Friends Within the Department

Make sure there is no bias or favoratism and that there is no perception of it

#### Limit the Number of Direct Reports

More junior and new employees will need more of your time

Don't have more direct reports than those that you can meet with at least once a week (one-on-one video or in person)

5 is a good max number of reports

Be careful not to let too many of these meetings slip

It is suggested to have them consolidate their issues for these one-on-one meetings to have them rely on themselves more and to try and minimize ad hoc support. (I don't completely agree with this methodology)

#### Even Tempor

Keeping cool at all times is important

Don't disguise your feelings though. Need people to trust you

## Chapter 3 - Building Trust and Confidence

### Success Habit

Establish a pattern of sucess. Provide them with tasks that they can succeed so they have confidence in you

Be gentle with failures

Work towards correcting the error, not criticizing the person

build confidence, not tearing them down

Praise in public, criticize in private

Though, praising in public can cause resentment or the person may feel self conscious

Solicit ideas for decision making processes that affect them. Make sure the exercise is sincere

Explain, without accussing, why any ideas givin are not taken

This results in more buy in

### Evils of Perfectionism

Expecting perfect outcomes may slow reports down thinking they have to over check things to make sure they don't screw up

### Importance of Building Trust

Share vision of the organization

Give individuals clear direction

Share examples of how you've succeeded and failed

## Chapter 4 - Show Your Appreciation

SPOT AWARDS!!!!

Praise lets them know that you care

Praise when appropriate and when it's deserved

### How to Give Praise

* Be specific - the more detail provided the more likely the behavior will be repeated
* Describe the impact - meeting goals of the individual, department, or organization. If broad, describe how it affected beyond the team
* Don't over do it - if given too often it could diminish the value
* Describe the Skill, action, etc that is the target of the appreciation
* Describe why you are praising them by addressing the result their work has contributed to

Make sure to recognize when reports are going above and beyond for you

## Chapter 5 - Being an Active Listener

Confirm you are listening by asking questions, making vocalizations, etc

Make sure you're doing at least twice as much listening as talking

Encourage the other person to talk

Be fully available in the conversation. Don't let your mind wander to other tasks

Make note of thoughts so you don't have to interrupt

Reiterrate what you think you've heard

### Winding Down Conversations

#### Non Subtle

* I appreciate you coming in
* it was nice talking to you
* you've given me a lot to think about
* let me think about that and get back to you

Mention you have a specific time window for discussion

#### More Subtle

Body gestures like:

* Putting hand on phone
* Looking towards paper work
* Standing up and walking over to guide you out the door

## Chapter 6 - New Job and Pitfalls to Avoid

* Couch
* Standard setter
* Performance appraiser
* Teacher
* Motivator
* Visionary

Pick the role that fits the situation and what you're trying to accomplish

Help your reports to become self directed

* Get their support and commitment
* Share power with them
* Remove obsticals for them

### Manager's Major Responsibilities

* Hiring
* Communicating - sharing vision and goals of the organization with reports. Also, what is happening within the department or unit.
* Planning - creating goals that meet the needs of your department and for the organizaton
* Organizing - deciding what work needs to be done and who will do it
* Training - identifying skill gaps and then taking measures to close those gaps
* Monitoring - making sure the work is being done and that your reports are succeeding in their assignments
* Evaluating - assessing, providing feedback, and comparing them to the levels needed for them and the team to be successful
* Firing - removing members that are unable to make contributions for themselves or the team to make them succeed

### Genuine Concern

Provide timely and useful information. Otherwise, they may find other avenues to get that information

Don't get overly involved in the details of reports tasks

Concentrate on the details of the overall project

Don't make your old job your occupational hobby because it's familiar

Often your first managerial position is a lead or project lead in which you manage others, but still have tasks of your own to perform. You wear two hats.

However, do help out during crunch times. Don't think of yourself as above others and the work to be done

Make sure to provide authority to complete tasks if it is needed

## Chapter 7 - Dealing with Your Superiors

* Keep your manager informated of your plans, actions, and projects
* Be considerate of managers time. Schedule meetings at their convenience
* Be well prepared. Present facts and backup positions
* Be willing to listen to your managers point of view. They may have information or experience that you lack

### Dealing with an Unreasonable Manager

Verify if it is substance and not style

Describe in a professional way how their actions have a negative impact on the business, moral, etc

Make it about the organization, not the person

"We maybe missing ways that we can be more effective"

For instance if your manager is providing direction to your reports conflicting with your own direction

If you go jump a level above your manager you may be severing your relationship with your manager

### Driving Good People Away

Poor management can drive away good employees

### Management Styles (Superiors)

* The monopolizers - like to be in charge of everything. make fast decisions (ready, fire, aim)
* The methoticals - analytic types. like to collect data before making a decision. hate to make decisions (aim, aim, aim)
* The motivators - fun to be around. charasmatic. talkers. may have difficulty getting the work done (talk, talk, talk)
* The mixers - dedicated, patient, sypathetic, understandable, relaxed, dependable, great at keeping the peace. Shy away from conflict and don't like change (ready, ready, ready)

Be attentive to:

1. How they process information
2. Level of detail they prefer
3. Level of immediacy they prefer
4. Topics that interest them
